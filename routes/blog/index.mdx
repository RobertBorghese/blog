# About

This is a blog documenting the progress of my various projects.
The large majority of which involve the [Haxe](https://haxe.org)
programming language.

My ultimate goal is to make a living off of game development; most
of my projects are intended to help me achieve that goal. For example,
my most popular open source project, [Reflaxe](https://github.com/RobertBorghese/reflaxe),
was created to help me develop a powerful Haxe -> C++ transpiler
that fits with my needs.

> [Reflaxe](https://github.com/RobertBorghese/reflaxe) is a Haxe framework
> for creating compilation targets using macros.

Another project of mine is [Haxe-UnrealEngine5](https://github.com/RobertBorghese/Haxe-UnrealEngine5),
an experimental attempt at allowing Haxe to be used in Unreal Engine 5
using the aforementioned [Reflaxe/C++](https://github.com/RobertBorghese/reflaxe.CPP)
project.

Finally, I also have a passion for language design, and frequently
try and find creative ways to modify or improve the code I write
through creative macros or language modifications. I ultimately
wish to develop my own programming language, and have made
[many](https://github.com/RobertBorghese/tastyfresh)
[attempts](https://github.com/RobertBorghese/gimmick)
[before](https://github.com/RobertBorghese/laxe).

> beautifully chained Array/Iterable extension functions.

Thanks for reading this! Hope you enjoy your stay.
